A web app to reduce Mexican college students' dropouts due to lack of financial resources or universities which fulfill their needs and expectations. How? Mere networking and virtual self-tracking!

## What it does
es tu o is the short expression for the sentence es tu oportunidad , that in Spanish means this is your opportunity . Our web app collects data, divided into three main categories: scholarships, university calls and prep courses for potential new students. Data is then prepared to be shown to our targets by using some cards. Our targets interact with our app by registering and signing up, to have access to a dashboard which helps them to keep an eye on their times and starred cards. As we have two main targets (high school and university students), we included some extra conditions to offer each one a different experience when using the app that fits best their needs.
